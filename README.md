#YouTubeMonster

YouTubeMonster is an opensource PHP project. I created this project for fun. If you want to make some changes, for the project and send a pull request, I'll seriously review them for deployment

## Todo before going live

* Twitter passwords in the gitignore
* Add cron job white list IP's to the config

## Run the project yourself for development

This project was created to run on a windows server, I'm sure that it will run on a linux machine too. You'll need:

* PHP 5.4
* MySQL
* SMTP enabled
